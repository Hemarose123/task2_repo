  <h3>
    Reaching the mountain top, whether literally or metaphorically, is always an
    achievement. These mountain top quotes offer a little wisdom and inspiration
    for those moments. 1. “Getting to the top is optional. Getting down is
    mandatory.”– Ed Viesturs 2. “I’ve realised that at the top of the mountain,
    there’s another mountain.”
